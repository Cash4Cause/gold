Reinforcement learning in Go!

## Why

Go is a lovely language that is efficient, reliable, and easy to grok.

There is a reproducability problem in machine learning. Go is prescriptive, lowering the threshold for entry and understanding of other peoples work. This allows us to build stronger communities.

Go is also an excellent distributed systems language, and RL is beginning to look more like a distributed system.
